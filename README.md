# FLASH KEYS

## Welcome:
A number of keyboard modifications to help navigate around Apple's shitty keyboard better. 

* Fix the stupid touchstrip by remapping `fn+[number keys]` to your `function` keys. 
* Fix the new stupid fat arrow keys by remapping `ctrl+[h,j,k,l]` to your respective `←↓↑→` keys.
* Finally use that big beautiful trackpad how it was intended. Drag an item across two 32" 4k UHD monitors with ease with `ctrl+spacebar`. It feels so natural that you'll wonder why Apple never thought of it.
